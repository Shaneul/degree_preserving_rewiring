# TODO

- [ ] Update setup.py, rebuild package and bump version
- [ ] Any additional result handling code should be handled outside the package depending on use case
- [x] Add more detailed results handling code
- [x] Make the changes to the negative rewiring code that have been made to the
      positive rewiring code
- [x] For simulating large numbers of graphs, we will not want detailed dataframes
      so add  something to summarise the results of each rewiring of a graph
      i.e., total number of edges rewired, etc.
- [x] Edit the negative rewiring full code
- [x] Each of the sample rewiring codes needs to be edited
